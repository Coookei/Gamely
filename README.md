## Setup 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository 🖥️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coookei/Gamely.git
cd Gamely
```

### 2. Install Dependencies 📦

Ensure that Node.js is installed. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Get an API Key 🔑

Create a free account and get an API key from [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs).

### 4. Add Environment Variables ⚙️

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.rawg.io/api/
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

_Note:_ See the Security section below for details on protecting your API key.

### 5. Start the server 🚀

Run the following command to start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at the URL shown in the console, normally `http://localhost:5173` on localhost.

## Security 🔒

Since Gamely is a front-end client app, any embedded API key will be visible in the browser’s network tab. To protect your RAWG API key, it's strongly recommended to use a proxy server that forwards requests and keeps your key secure.

You can use Gamely Proxy built with TypeScript, Express, and Node.js: [Gamely-Proxy](https://github.com/Coookei/Gamely-Proxy).

### Using a Proxy

When running your own proxy server, only one environment variable is needed:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-proxy-url.com/
```

If you're hosting Gamely on **Vercel**, you can configure a clean URL by amending the rewrite rule in your `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "https://your-proxy-url.com/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you can simplify your environment variable:

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api/
```

Your proxy will now be accessible at `https://your-gamely-url.com/api`
